# tf-aws-dev-ec2
This is djoo's simple terraform demo repository to demonstrate an example and benefits of :
* Infrastructure as Code 
* Terraform 
* Terraform Cloud (TFC). 


Through the Terraform code an EC2 - RHEL8 VM will be created and the EC2's global IP will be shown as an OUTPUT.  


## Prerequisite:  
The code is expecting, "aws_dev_vpc" to be available from TFC's "djoo-hashicorp" & "tf-aws-network-dev" workspace.
